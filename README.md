Archv_java is a collection of tools built upon the OpenCV library for creating Lucene buckets of visual words (BOVW) 
representations of images of printed materials.  It works in conjunction with the Arch-V Java Toolset 
(https://bitbucket.org/cstahmer/archv_java) to provide scalable visual search capability for archives of printed 
materials. Development of the codebase was initially supported by a Start-Up Grant from the National Endowment for 
the Humanities (NEH.) Continued development is a labor of love and necessity (pending future funding.)

The code is made available under a creative commons Attribution Share-Alike (CC BY-SA 4.0) License

The codebase is currently under heave development and there is presently no user documentation. This is one of the 
things we hope to provide with future funding. For information of how to implement or contribute, contact Carl Stahmer
